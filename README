Domain_check: 

Gkrellm2 plugin to check if your sub domains points to your external ip address.
I made this because my domain provider does not support dynamic ip adress update,
and because my external ip changes so seldom that it is possible to manually update
the account at my domain provider when the ip address change.

So this plugin monitors the sub domains and check if they have the correct address.
I use system command calling wget from checkip.dyndns.org to fetch a file
with the external address. This file is written to /tmp/. 
This makes the plugin only compatible with linux and installations that has wget
installed. Sorry about that. 
Anyway, it is mostly a tool for my own use and used to refresh some ansi c knowledge.
