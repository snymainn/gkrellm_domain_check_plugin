Domain_check: 

Gkrellm2 plugin to check if your sub domains points to your external ip address.
I made this because my domain provider does not support dynamic ip adress update,
and because my external ip changes so seldom that it is possible to manually update
the account at my domain provider when the ip address change.

So this plugin monitors the sub domains and check if they have the correct address.

I use linux host command to fetch external ip address as suggested by this web page:
